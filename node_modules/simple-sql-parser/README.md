var simpleSqlParser = require('simple-sql-parser');
```

### Parse a query:

```js
var ast = simpleSqlParser.sql2ast('your SQL query');
console.log(ast);
```

### Create a query from AST:

```js
var query = simpleSqlParser.ast2sql(ast);
console.log(query);

*AST means Abstract Syntax Tree.*

## Examples

* See `example.html` (open brower's console)
* Have a look to the unit tests `tests/tests.js` to see what's possible

simpleSqlParser **is not a full SQL parser!**
It only support few SQL mechanisms and keywords.
